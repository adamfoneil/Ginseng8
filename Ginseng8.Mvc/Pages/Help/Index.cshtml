<h3>In a Nutshell</h3>
<div class="ml-3">
    <p>Ginseng is for small business and software teams to track software projects and tasks.</p>
</div>

<h4>Definitions</h4>
<div class="ml-3">
    <p>In Ginseng, you connect to or create an <strong>organization</strong>. An organization is the top-level container of all your data.
    You can belong to more than one organization. To change your organization, use <a asp-page="/Setup/OrgUser">Org Settings</a>.</p>

    <p>Ginseng is built around <a asp-page="/Help/Projects">projects</a> and <a asp-page="/Help/WorkItems">work items</a>. The terms &quot;task&quot; and &quot;work item&quot; are 
        conversationally interchangeable, but Ginseng uses the term &quot;work item&quot;. A project is a group of work items organized
        around a feature or other unifying theme. A work item is a single task within a project that can be estimated and done by one person.
        An <strong>application</strong> is a product your team develops. Projects and work items apply to applications.
        See: <a asp-page="/Setup/Applications">Setup Applications</a></p>

    <p>To describe a due date or deadline, use <strong>milestones</strong>. By themselves, projects and work items have no due dates. When
        you select a milestone for a work item, that becomes its due date. See: <a asp-page="/Setup/Milestones">Setup Milestones</a>, 
        <a asp-page="/Dashboard/Calendar">Calendar</a></p>

    <p>Use <strong>labels</strong> on work items to describe them in a shorthand way, so people can tell at a glance what their scope or impact might be.
        For example, you will typically have a &quot;bug&quot; label to describe defects, and a &quot;feature&quot; label to describe enhancements.
        A single work item may have multiple labels. See: <a asp-page="/Setup/Labels">Setup Labels</a></p>

    <p>Team workflow typically involves multiple <strong>activities</strong> such as &quot;Development&quot; and &quot;Testing&quot;.
        To advance the workflow, you <strong>hand-off</strong> work items from one activity to the next.
        See: <a asp-page="/Setup/Activities">Setup Activities</a>, <a asp-page="/Setup/AppActivities">My App Activities</a></p>

    <p>A work item <strong>Card</strong> is the UI of a single work item that expands and collapses when its heading is clicked on.</p>
</div>

<h4>Navigating</h4>
<div class="ml-3">
    <p>The home page link in the upper left shows the <strong>organization</strong> you're connected to, and takes 
    you to the <a asp-page="/Dashboard/Index">My Items</a> page, one of several <a asp-page="/Help/Dashboard">dashboard</a> pages. These pages have 
    a menu across the top and are where you'll spend most of your time in Ginseng. See: <a asp-page="DashboardPages">Dashboard Pages</a></p>

    <p>The dropdown the right of the home page link shows the current application you're focused on. Selecting an application
    here filters the presentation of all pages to that application.</p>

    <p>In this example, the current organization is <em>aosoftware</em> and the current app is <em>Ginseng</em>:</p>
